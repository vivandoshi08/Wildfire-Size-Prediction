#Hello my name is Vivan Doshi, and I created a website that uses linear regression, stochastic gradient descent(sgd), random forest regression, RANSAC, and SVR to predict the size of a fire based on the inputs given. I used this datset(https://www.kaggle.com/elikplim/forest-fires-data-set) for the regression.
